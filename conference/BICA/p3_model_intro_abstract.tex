This paper provides a new cognitive meta-architecture for artificial
intelligent systems (AI and robotics). Three basic domains are the backbone 
of this architecture: physiology, psychology and philosophy, respectively 
describing sensorimotor/physical, data processing and symbolic and meta levels.
This architecture is inspired by real anthropocentric performances, and makes 
possible model from sensorimotor processes to symbolic.
