  \item The system developed in this paper, includes innovative methods and algorithms for decision support, uses a generalized model of thinking Minsky;
  \item Presents visualization of the structure of the region remote support infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}

Presented in the thesis model of thinking, its architecture and implementation are unique~--- at this time it is the only implementation of the Minsky model of thinking. \par
The system developed in the thesis, is highly specialized and suitable for other areas where required knowledge base, for example, when the medical diagnosis in order to reject the false diagnoses. \par
In the diagnosis of problems you can train the system information about the components of the car and problems associated with them, the signs of these problems and their solutions. \par
Work is performed partially at the expense of the subsidy allocated to Kazan Federal University for the state assignment in the sphere of scientific activities, projects 1.2368.2017, «Budget 17-97».
