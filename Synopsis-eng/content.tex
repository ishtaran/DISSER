\subsection*{\center{General description of work}}The area of research in which the thesis is complex and involves different areas of work, in particular, creation of intelligent systems. Scope intelligent systems are vast, for example, in the Institute Starting (India) E. Jubilson and P. Dhanavantini conducting research of intellectual systems of processing of user requests in the field of telecommunications, and the University of Hannover (Germany) R. Bruns and George Dankel develop intelligent systems for query processing in service of rescue to reduce response time to incident. In Saint-Petersburg state University (SPSU) under the leadership of V. I. Zolotarev assesses the effectiveness of an information service support in the computer center of SPBU. In Singapore S. Fu and P. Leong made the analysis of the effectiveness of large companies support and the possibility of some processes automation (IT~-- information technology).\par
Research in the field of intelligent systems to improve the efficiency of it services companies are also leaders in the it industry: HP Company \footnote{The project \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_OpenView}} and IBM \footnote{The project \url{http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/}}. For example, the famous multi-purpose intelligent system IBM Watson, the development and study of which the unit under the guidance of Professor A. Goel.  \par   In order that the system can work with user requests, it must \quoted{understand} the language in which they are made. Such problems are studied in the field of natural language processing. For example, this is the GATE approach \footnote{The project \url{https://gate.ac.uk/}}, which is actively developing at the University of Sheffield (UK) under the direction of G. Callaghan, L. Moffat and S. Szaz. Another direction~--- this semantic search, research in this area has also actively conducted at the University of Sheffield, in particular, the developed approach Mimir, which implements the search functionality on the principle "search and discovery". For search of solutions in accordance with user requests in such systems, ontologies are used, for example, the widely used approach proposed by S. Dey and A. James from University of California (USA) based on the use of trees of tags in the ontology. \par
To give to the intelligent flexibility is needed to enable it to carry out logical reasoning. One of the leading organizations in this line of research is a OpenCog consortium \footnote{The project \url{http://opencog.org/}} (USA). These works leads by Ben Hertzel (Chairman of Artificial General Intelligence Society and OpenCog Foundation)~--- one of the world leaders in the field of artificial intelligence. Research in the field of machine logic is also underway in the framework of The projectа NARS \footnote{The project \url{https://sites.google.com/site/narswang/}} under the guidance of Temple University Professor (USA) Pey Wong. \par

\subsection*{The content of the work}
In \textbf{introduction} it justifies urgency of studies conducted in the framework of the thesis; the General characteristics work and analysis of research in the field of maintenance of information infrastructure of the company; reviewed and based on the identified growth publication activity in the subject area (according to Scopus) the urgency of the research conducted. \par

\textbf{First Chapter} the thesis is devoted to the formulation and review of intelligent systems recording and analysing problem situations that arise in it the infrastructure of the enterprise.
The Chapter begins with descriptions of models of the theory of mass service (TMS) for services involved in Troubleshooting the problem situations arising in the it infrastructure of the enterprise. In picture \ref{img:mass_service} presents a model of a Queuing system in which the following designations are used: $\lambda$ --- the intensity of the incoming stream;  
$\alpha$ --- the share of applications for which the waiting time in the queue exceeds $max(T_q)$;       
$\mu$ --- the reciprocal of the average time spent by the application agent;
$n$ --- the number of agents;
$T_q$ --- time orders in the queue in hours;
$SLA$ --- the level of service or the share of applications for which the time in the queue does not exceed $max(T_q)$, $SLA=1-\alpha$;
 $T_p$ --- the time of satisfaction of the application;
 $\alpha_n$ --- the number of applications;
 $T_{qp}=T_q+T_p$ --- the time of passage of applications through the system;
 $S(\mu)= \frac{R_p}{\mu} $ --- the average cost of performing a single application;
 $R_p$ --- the average cost of a working hour of a specialist (displayed next).

  \includegraphics [scale=0.8] {mass_service-eng}
  \caption{The model of queueing system.} 
  \label{img:mass_service}  
\end{figure}
There are several approaches for solving tasks of TMO: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item An analytical solution for the simplest systems, which allows to express $T_q (t)$ through $\lambda$, $\mu$ и $n$;
	\item The solution using a simulation approach, where a histogram of $T_q (t)$, against which to measure the adequacy of $n$ for ensuring of SLA;
	\item Solution using the econometric approach, which is suitable for systems with a sufficiently large $n$. In such systems it is possible to estimate $T_q (t)$ according to the statistics.
\end{itemize} \par
Based on the combination of the Erlang formulas, Engset model and Polyachek model ~--~CHinchin built the formula for the solution of tasks of TMO on the basis of the analytical approach by finding the probability distribution for $T_{qp}$. The main task of the this work is the prediction of necessary resources to maximize $SLA$ ($SLA=1-\alpha$). In Chapter 1 of the thesis we consider the problem of minimizing $T_{qp}$, $S(\mu)$ and dynamic resource allocation. Based on the statistics collected in the company \icl,~ was calculated the following ratio $T_{qp}=47,9$ при $n=6$; $SLA=0,82$; $\alpha=0,18$;  $\alpha_n=2920$.  \par
Chapter 1 also presented comparative analysis of the registration systems and resolve problem situations; establishes the basic requirements for intelligent systems and  analysis of problem situations in the it field. One important element of such systems is natural language processing, therefore, in this Chapter comparative analysis of methods and software packages word processing. \par
The analysis has used the following tools natural language processing: Open NLP\footnote{The project \url{http://opennlp.apache.org}}, Relex\footnote{The project \url{http://opencog.org}}, StanfordParser\footnote{The project \url{http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml}}. Evaluation of quality of functioning of these funds were held using the metrics presented in table \ref{Metrics}, and the results are shown in figure \ref{img:ParserCompare}. As can be seen, the best result in all three metrics showed the system Relex, she was selected as the primary means of natural language processing. \par

%=================
%===Second chapter
%=================

\textbf{The Second Chapter} пsanctified the construction of a model 

intelligent decision-making system for recording and analysing problem situations in the it infrastructure of the enterprise. Consider three fundamental approach to solving the problem:
 \begin{itemize}
	\item model Menta 0.1, built using decision trees;
	\item модель Menta 0.3, built using genetic algorithms;
	\item model TU 1.0, based on the model of thinking of Marvin Minsky.
\end{itemize} \par
Note the model built on the basis of neural networks (supporting training), was rejected at the preliminary assessment stage, as it makes large performance requirements that in turn leads to high cost. Next, each model is described in detail.

\textbf{Model of Menta 0.1, built using decision trees}, was one of the first that was tested. When building the model used the following 

Components: processing natural language queries; the search for a solution; applying the solution. \par
The system is designed to execute simple commands for example, the "add field to form". In General, the system is characterized by the following algorithm:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item obtaining and formalization of the request;
	\item finding solutions with the help of trees decision-making;
	\item changing the model of application format OWL;
	\item generate and compile the application.
\end{enumerate} \par
In the result of experiments revealed the absence of error tolerance, input: grammatical and meaningful. For example, the input file is not relate to a software system model which contained in the knowledge base; the system solver only worked in the framework of the one programme; there was no learning function. \par

\textbf{Model of Menta 0.3, built using genetic algorithms}.In this model, compared to 
the previous module has been added to the logic for evaluating solutions and the module of genetic algorithms to generate solutions. In the model of Menta 0.3 was fulfilled the following basic Components of the future final model: acceptance criteria (Acceptance Criteria); How-To~--- storage solutions analyzed problems; the data format is OWL; the use of logical calculations to validate the solution. System 0.3 Menta contain, as a Component of part, model the target application (as Menta 0.1) and a list of solutions to certain problems (How-To) found earlier. With the help of genetic algorithm the model was built the solution, checked it with a logic engine NARS\footnote{\url{http://www.cogsci.indiana.edu/farg/peiwang/papers.html}} on the criteria defined by the user. From the point of view of genetic algorithms, this check is~--- function selection of individuals from generation.  \par
In the result of the experiments identified the following problems: lack of training; lack of natural language processing; after testing it turned out that the list of criteria the solution of the requirement of the user (rules) almost describe the necessary decision (the one that should be found) that was invalid. \par


\textbf{The TU model 1.0, model-based thinking Marvin Minsky}, was built using well-known theories of Marvin Minsky\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emotion_Machine}}, retained the following main conceptual elements previous models and has demonstrated its viability in the control examples: Acceptance Criteria; training; finding and applying solutions; no natural language processing. This model is more versatile and is a high level architecture of the query processing (thinking) where Components are best in terms of functionality Components of the previous systems. Implemented model is called TU, and demonstrated its viability in the control examples (from English "Thinking andUnderstanding\"~~--- «thinking and understanding»). \par

One of the main Components of the system TU is a triplet \triplet\ (later \tripletshort), schematic representation of which is presented in figure \ref{img:csw}. The critic responds, the Selector selects the resource, a Way of thinking does work.
\begin{figure} [h] 
  \center
  \includegraphics [scale=1.0] {CSW-en}
  \caption{\tripletshort} 
  \label{img:csw}  
\end{figure}


\emph{Critic} is a switch that is triggered under certain events. For example, "turn on the light, and the pupils are narrowed", "burned and pulled hand." Critic is activated only when enough circumstances. At the same time can be activated several Critic. For example, man solves a difficult task, there is activation of many Critic: to calculate, to clarify the technical details. In addition, the parallel may Critic is activated to control the activity level of reporting needed rest.\par
\emph{Selector} deals with the selection of required resources which, for example, can be: a Critic, a way of thinking. \par
\emph{Way of thinking}~--- this method of solving the problem. It can be challenging and, for example, can activate other Critic. So, thinking about the problem, the specialist understands that it is necessary to consider all possible combinations, and then he decides look for a turnkey solution: maybe someone has already considered all the possible combinations, and you can use it. Here, the "search solutions" is Critic inside the way of thinking "search solution".\par

On the picture \ref{img:csw_ex} presents an expanded model of work \tripletshort. Critic activates the selector, which returns the resource way of thinking (the circles marked with a variety of resources: Criticи, selectors, ways of thinking \etc). Last in turn, you can activate a new Criticа or to perform certain actions. For example, there was a problem related to lack of access, so, we need to run the utility to grant rights to the user. Under the resource here refers to knowledge from knowledge base: Critics, selectors, ways of thinking, ready-made solution. \par 
If activated a lot of Critic, the problem needs to be clarified, otherwise the uncertainty will be too high. If the problem is very similar to the already analysed, it is possible to act and to judge by analogy. \par
\begin{figure} [h] 
  \center
  \includegraphics [scale=0.6] {CSW_EX_en}
  \caption{\tripletshort\ in the context of resources} 
  \label{img:csw_ex}  
\end{figure}
Another important part of the theory of Minsky are the levels of thinking. This concept distributes the activity of thinking between 6 levels: the higher the level, the stronger the activity. The Table \ref{ThinkingLevelDescription} the description of levels of thinking with examples. \par
The study of models of thinking was completed and was made conclusions, the main of which are as follows.

\hline
  Instinctive level & instinctive reactions Occur (congenital). For example, the knee-jerk reaction. The General formula for this level can be expressed as "if ... then do so" \\
  \hline Learned level & Use the accumulated knowledge, i.e. the knowledge that a person trained in the course of life. For example, to cross the road on green light. The General formula for this level can be described as "if ... then do so" \\
  \hline Deliberative level & Thinking using reasoning. For example, if you cross the road on green light, you can make it in time. At this level compares the effects of several solutions and select the optimal. The General formula for this level can be expressed as "if ... then to make so then be it" \\
  \hline
Reflective level & Reasoning based on the analysis of past events. For example, "the last time I ran on the blinking green and almost got hit by a car" \\

  \hline
  Self-reflective level & Build a specific model, which is an estimation of the actions. For example, "my decision not to go to the meeting was incorrect, since I missed so many chances, I was distracted" \\
  \hline
  Self-Conscious level & Evaluation of their actions from the point of view of higher ideals and assessments of others. For example, "what will my friends think? And how would my hero react?" \\
   
\end{longtable}

For the software expert system is very important to have the ability to think and reason, for example, to proceed by analogy. A lot of typical queries, the queries differ only in the parameters. For example, one of them is a request "please install Office, Antivirus» \etc\ For expert systems it is important to be able to abstract specialized solution recipes. For example, the system learned to resolve the incident "Please install Firefox"\comma\ to obstreperous the incident to the extent "Please install browser"\comma\ the system will be able the same the way to fix the problem "Please install Chrome"\comma\ same as concept "Firefox"\ and "Chrome"\ linked through the concept of "Browser". \par
After consideration of multiple models was chosen as model of thinking Marvin Minsky, as it best matches the target region support of it infrastructure of the enterprise. Based on the approach Minsky built a model of the system that implements the core functions: teaching, understanding of the incident, search solutions, application solutions.

WayToThink runs Critic thoughts to find the root of the problem. He finds CurrentState (the current status)~--- Wordfinder Tehcnical and DesiredState (the condition that the user needs)~--- Wordfinder Business Economical;

For the system created the unique data model~--- TU Knowledge, which combines OWL and graph database. The OWL that appeared to structure the information in the web, has gained wide use in many data schemas, as it gave the opportunity for more extended descriptions of the relationships between.
